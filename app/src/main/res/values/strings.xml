    <string name="title2">What is Eco-Score ?</string>
    <string name="description1">A Nutri-Score calculation pinpoints the nutritional value of a product (based on the ingredients) and assigns it to one of the five colour-coded letter grade classes (A, B, C, D, or E). Products that get an A score have the highest nutritional value â€” those that score an E have the lowest nutritional value.</string>
    <string name="description2">Eco-Score classes food products from A (low) to E (high) according to their impact on the environment. Eco-Score aims to inform consumers on the environmental impact of the food they choose so as to guide them towards more responsible consumption.</string>
    <string name="title3">Scoring System:</string>
    <string name="description3">
        <b>Glycemic Index (GI): If the GI is available, use it as-is.\n</b>
        Low GI (0-55): +2 points\n
        Medium GI (56-69): +1 point\n
        High GI (70+): 0 points\n\n<b>Total Carbohydrates: Use the per-100g value.</b>\n
        Low carbs (0-10g per 100g): +2 points\n
        Moderate carbs (11-20g per 100g): +1 point\n
        High carbs (21+g per 100g): 0 points\n\n<b>Sugar Content: Use the per-100g value.</b>\n

        Low sugar (0-5g per 100g): +2 points\n
        Moderate sugar (6-10g per 100g): +1 point\n
        High sugar (11+g per 100g): 0 points\n\n<b>Dietary Fiber: Use the per-100g value.</b>\n

        High fiber (3g+ per 100g): +2 points\n
        Moderate fiber (1-2g per 100g): +1 point\n
        Low fiber (0g per 100g): 0 points\n\n<b>Fat Content: This can be further broken down into healthy and unhealthy fats, if the data is available.</b>\n

        Healthy fats (e.g., unsaturated fats): +1 point\n
        Unhealthy fats (e.g., saturated fats): 0 points\n\n
        <b>Glycemic Index(GI) calculation:</b>\n\nGI = ( ( (sugar) + ( (carb) - (fiber) - (sugar) ) * 0.5 ) / (carb) ) * 100
